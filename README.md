attempt to autostitch the videos on first run
save this stitching config/transform
allowuser to move the images themselves in new stitched pattorn
save this as default trasnform
dread in if we have a transfrom everyy run

blindly use this transform to stitch for the rest of runtime, since cameras dont move relative to eachother
